[Flux.jl](https://fluxml.ai/Flux.jl/stable/) is Julia's deep learning library. In a previous post on [the Julia programming language](https://lifei.tech/posts/julia/), We've already studied some source code of Flux in detail. Now let's have a look at how we can use it to construct deep learning models.

Examples:
- metalhead.jl
- model zoo
