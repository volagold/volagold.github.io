## Deep Learning with Flux.jl

![Julia Flux](/assets/imgs/julia/flux.png){: width="800" height="500" .shadow}

[Flux.jl](https://fluxml.ai/Flux.jl/stable/) is Julia's deep learning library. We've already studied some source code of Flux in detail. Now let's have a look at how we can use it to construct deep learning models.

Examples:
- metalhead.jl
- model zoo
